//EZ-E2E
basic idea, currently e2e test wether that be through protractor and selenium or whatever are time consuming and not intuitive to new users, what 
EZ-E2E plans to do is record all mouse movement, clicks, key input, and have shortcuts for otherthings like testing if something is disabled and 
then take all of that recording and convert it into protractor js tests!
